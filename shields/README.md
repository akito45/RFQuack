# Feather Huzzah Shields

We provide two reference shields that work on Feather Huzzah (one for ESP8266 and the other for ESP32), V-Chip's VT-CC112x module and E01-ML01SP2 module (nRF24L01 + PA + PLNA).

## License

Our design is licensed as RFQuack main project, including the symbol and footprint for VT-CC112x.

Referred footprints and symbols, including but not limited to FeatherWing (DIM), are either MIT, Apache, or simply CC0.
