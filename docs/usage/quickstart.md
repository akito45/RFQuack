RFQuack is quite experimental, expect glitches and imperfections. So far we're quite happy with it, and used it successfully to analyze some industrial radio protocols (read the [Trend Micro Research white paper](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/attacks-against-industrial-machines-via-vulnerable-radio-remote-controllers-security-analysis-and-recommendations) or the [DIMVA 2019 paper](https://www.dimva2019.org) for details).

### Prepare Your Hardware

- Choose the radio chip and board that you want to use among the supported ones: we tested the CC1101, nRF24 and ESP32-based boards (namely the Adafruit Feather HUZZAH32).
- Assemble the board and the radio chip together: if you choose the Adafruit Feather system, all you have to do is stack the boards together, and do some minor soldering.
- Connect the board to the USB port.

You could play around with other combinations, of course. And if you feel generous, you can fork this repository, add support for untested hardware, and send us a pull request (including schematics for new daughter-boards)! üëè
