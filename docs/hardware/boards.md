In principle, RFQuack is based on the Arduino framework, which works on several platforms thanks to PlatformIO. However, we tested it with the following boards.

Please set the `board = ...` parameter in your `platformio.ini` file accordingly.

## ESP32

- `featheresp32`: [Adafruit ESP32 Feather](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/espressif32/featheresp32.html)
- `az-delivery-devkit-v4`: [az-delivery-devkit-v4](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/espressif32/az-delivery-devkit-v4.html)

## Teensy
